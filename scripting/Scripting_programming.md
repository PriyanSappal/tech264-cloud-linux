## Scripting
- **Complexity:** usually simpler
- **Purpose:** usually to automate simple or routine tasks
- **Execution:** usually by an interpreter
- **Development cycle:** usually shorter
- **Learning curve:** usually easier to learn

To run a python script you will need to run it on the command line and you need to start with `python` -> interpret. e.g. `python .\test_for_arg.py hello`:
* `\test_for_arg.py` -> sys.argv[0] (name of the python script)
* `hello` -> [1] (arguments from the user)
  
## Programming
- **Complexity:** usually more complex, often includes more complex logic, data structures, and algorithms
- **Purpose:** much wider purpose, including large applications and games
- **Execution:** either interpreted or needs to be compiled before being run
- **Development cycle:** usually longer and more involved in SDLC phases
- **Learning curve:** usually more involved to learn, including software design patterns
